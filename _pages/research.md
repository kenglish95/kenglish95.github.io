My PhD in Sociology researched how differences in terms of sex and gender should be represented by UK population surveys. The research focuses on the perspectives of those currently overlooked in survey data. To achieve this a sequential mixed-methods design was employed. I was funded by the University of Glasgowâ€™s College of Social Sciences (CoSS) Scholarship.
