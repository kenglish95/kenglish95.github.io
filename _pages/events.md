### <span style="color:#FF00CC "> Binary barriers: Representing trans & gender diverse populations in censuses & other population surveys: Mind the Gap Conference </span>
###### July 30th-31st 2022

The 2021/2022 UK censuses represent significant steps forward for the creation of population estimates for LGBTI+ people. However, this progress has been hampered by unprecedented controversy, linked to the UK’s climate of transphobia (Hines, 2020). Academics such as Sullivan (2020) claim to be resisting the conflation of sex and gender in data collection, while promoting “legal sex” question guidance that if followed produces ambiguous data on both concepts, without singling either one out. From a queer feminist stand point, this paper argues that the conflation of sex and gender in the UKs censuses and other population surveys is not new and that the way to address this is by actively including trans and gender diverse people when designing surveys. Findings from a review of current UK population survey practices are utilised to highlight how some experiences of sex and gender are excluded. I then focus on how narrow conceptualisations of sex and gender in the latest censuses have prevented the production of data on the size of the UKs non-binary population and needlessly distorted what could have been ground-breaking data on sex and gender. Online focus groups and an online survey of 347 LGBTI+ people in the UK were utilised, to identify potential solutions to these issues. Showing that representing trans and gender diverse people in data will not hinder our understanding of gender inequality, has been one of the approaches adopted by trans inclusive researchers (Fugard, 2020). This paper goes further, by showing that queering survey methods is essential for gaining a useful understanding sex and gender. By working with survey respondents we can understand on what basis survey questions are answered enabling reliable and intricate presentations of populations.

###### 6th September 2021  
The 2021/2022 UK censuses represent significant steps forward for the production of data on the LGBTQ+ population. However, this progress has been hampered by unprecedented controversy, linked to the UK’s climate of transphobia (Hines, 2020). Academics such as Sullivan (2020) claim to be resisting the conflation of sex and gender in data collection while promoting “legal sex” question guidance that if followed produces more ambiguous data. This paper argues that the conflation of sex and gender in the UKs censuses and other population surveys is not new and that the way to address this is by incorporating trans representative survey practices. Findings from reviewing current UK population survey practices will be utilised to highlight core limitations in how sex and gender are represented. The paper will then focus on how narrow conceptualisations of sex in the census have prevented the production of data on the size of the UKs non-binary population and needlessly distorted what could have been ground-breaking data on sex and gender. Potential solutions to these issues will be discussed based on preliminary findings from direct engagement with groups currently overlooked by the UK’s representation of sex and gender in surveys. Showing that representing trans people in data will not hinder our understanding of gender inequality has been one of the approaches adopted by trans inclusive researchers (Fugard, 2020). This paper aims to go further by showing that trans representative survey practices are essential for gaining an accurate understanding sex and gender.
