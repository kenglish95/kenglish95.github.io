The following is a 5 minute zine I made in October. It touches on some ways I have personally been overlooked or misrepresented by surveys. These issues formed one of the key motivations for my research. I have often been overlooked by surveys or forced into ill-fitting boxes. I hope that my research can identify ways to prevent this happening for myself and everyone else who has ever been overlooked by survey designers. This zine and my research focuses on sex, gender and sexuality. However, poor question design is an issue for a range of characteristics.

Here are some of my personal issues with survey questions. Zine page 2: A drawing of me squeezed into a check box for Gay/lesbian. There is a speech bubble coming from me that says bit of a tight fit")

Zine page 6: Without proper representative data intersections of experiences are rendered invisible and policy only considers an arbitrary norm. This is accompanied by a drawing of a crowd.")
