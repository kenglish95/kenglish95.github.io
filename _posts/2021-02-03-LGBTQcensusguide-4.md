One person in the household usually fills in the census for everyone. If you do not wish for the people you live with to see your responses you can request an individual form.The letter with the code will tell you how to request an individual or paper form.Your information will be kept private.All census data is anonymised for 100 years")

This means that on the online census you won't be able to skip it.The aim of this question is to understand how many men or women there are in the UK. Meaning if you are a trans man you should select male and if you are a trans woman you should select female. It is unknown what guidance will accompany this question. However, even if the guidance states that it is asking about legal sex at no point will anyone check if you have a GRC or ask to see your birth certificate.")

It is an optional question meaning it can be skipped on the online form. Select yes if: You are a man who was assigned male at birth You are a woman who was assigned female at birth Select no if: You are a man who was assigned female at birth You are a woman who was assigned male at birth You are not a man or woman If you select no make sure to use the text box to indicate how you identify. This is particularly important if you are non-binary since it is the only opportunity to have your relationship to gender recorded.")
