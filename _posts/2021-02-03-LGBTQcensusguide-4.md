The 21st of March 2021 is census day in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. This census year is of particular importance to the LGBTQ+ community. Here I provide some information for LGBTQ+ people filling in the census. As a non-binary person, I'm disappointed by the use of a binary sex question. However, that makes the optional text box in the "sex registered at birth" question more important. If your trans and/or non-binary please make use of that box so our community is represented accurately.

One person in the household usually fills in the census for everyone. If you do not wish for the people you live with to see your responses you can request an individual form.The letter with the code will tell you how to request an individual or paper form.Your information will be kept private.All census data is anonymised for 100 years")
![](/images/censusguide4.png "The sex question This is the only mandatory gender or sexuality question. This means that on the online census you won't be able to skip it.The aim of this question is to understand how many men or women there are in the UK. Meaning if you are a trans man you should select male and if you are a trans woman you should select female. It is unknown what guidance will accompany this question. However, even if the guidance states that it is asking about legal sex at no point will anyone check if you have a GRC or ask to see your birth certificate.")
![](/images/censusguide5.png "The gender and sex registered at birth question This question will only be asked in England and Wales. It is for people ages 16 and over. It is an optional question meaning it can be skipped on the online form. Select yes if: You are a man who was assigned male at birth You are a woman who was assigned female at birth Select no if: You are a man who was assigned female at birth You are a woman who was assigned male at birth You are not a man or woman If you select no make sure to use the text box to indicate how you identify. This is particularly important if you are non-binary since it is the only opportunity to have your relationship to gender recorded.")

If you do not feel represented by the options provided please make use of the write in box. You might use this to state that you are:	Asexual  Aromantic  Pansexual Polyamorous	Queer Questioning Someone that doesn't identify ")
