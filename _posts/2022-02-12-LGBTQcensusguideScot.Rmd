The 20th of March 2022 is census day in Scotland. This census year is of particular importance to the LGBTQ+ community. Here I provide some information for LGBTQ+ people filling in the census. As a non-binary person, I'm disappointed by the use of a binary sex question. However, that makes the optional text box in the "trans status or trans history" question more important. If your trans please make use of that box so our community is represented accurately.

Between the end of February 2022 and March 20th your household will receive a letter with instructions for taking part.One person in the household usually fills in the census for everyone. If you do not wish for the people you live with to see your responses you can request an individual form. Any reponses provided on an individual form will overide responses about you on your household form The letter will include information on how to request an individual or paper copy online or over the phone Your information will be kept private.All census data is anonymised  for 100 years")

![](/images/png4.png "The sex question This is the only mandatory gender or sexuality question. This means that on the online census you won't be able to skip it.The aim of this question is to understand how many men or women there are in the UK. Meaning if you are a trans man you should select male and if you are a trans woman you should select female. It is unknown what guidance will accompany this question. However, even if the guidance states that it is asking about legal sex at no point will anyone check if you have a GRC or ask to see your birth certificate.")

Select no if:You are a man who was assigned male at birthYou are a woman who was assigned female at birthSelect yes if: You are a man who was assigned female at birthYou are a woman who was assigned male at birthYour relationship to gender doesn't fit within the category of man or woman Make sure to use the text box to indicate how you identify. This is particularly important if you are non-binary since it is the only opportunity to have your relationship to gender recorded.")

It is an optional question meaning it can be skipped on the online and paper forms.If you do not feel represented by the options provided please make use of the write in box. You might use this to state that you are:Asexual Aromantic PansexualPolyamorous QueerQuestioningSomeone that doesn't identify ")
